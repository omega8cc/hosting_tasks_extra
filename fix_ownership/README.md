FIX OWNERSHIP
=============

This extension will help Aegir to fix file ownership for Drupal platforms and
sites.

A full discussion on proper file ownership and permissions in Drupal can be
found at: https://www.drupal.org/node/244924

On Debian and Ubuntu systems, run `sudo bash scripts/install.sh` in order to
deploy these scripts, and set up the proper sudoers entry. Other Unixes may
require slightly different steps to add the sudoers entry.
